              Only few people are innocent and pure from heart , you're one of them. You have been a constant in my college life right from my first year to the final year. Miss those gossips we used to do in class , miss asking those assignments and important questions to you. Thank you for being my exam savior I wouldn't have cleared B.Tech without you

I will always be there for you whenever you need me.

Happy birthday Tanya !

Your knowledge and strength is amazing and inspirational . Thankyou for lighting up our lives with that “chup raho,Tum log bhi na😄”and the savage memes you share. ❤️❤️❤️

              I can never express my love for you with words. It’s hard to imagine a life without you. Being with you feels like paradise. Thank you for being the perfect example of a best friend.You are someone with whom I not only share my happiness but also share my sadness too. I love you, my best friend.
You make people forget  about their sorrows and sufferings with your positivity and your knowledge.I have wondered about how you can see positivity through so much negative also.

I thank you every day for making me realize what is friendship. You mean so much to me. Always take care of yourself.I appreciate your love, kindness, and support for everyone.Do you still remember the good old days where we would do funny and stupid things together? Life was magical back then . I promise you to live the same old days with you once this time is over and I love you so much my Tanya di ❤️You have immeasurable potential and superb caliber of achieving all success that you want in life. You’re the worlds best cook and you literally serve happiness my love. We’re building our friendship  through tears and laughter, securing every brick with common experience and sometimes few bad days . But that’s what makes it stronger. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, your friend will always understand and support you and don’t be sad ever . M always there for you and can’t can’t can’t see that face losing the smile and the eyes losing their spark ⚡️ ❤️
